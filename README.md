Bootstrapx Popoverx
===================

Inspired by lecar-red's bootstrapx-clickover, adding hover ability which also performs the same functions with clickover.

Quick Start
-----------
After including bootstrapx-popoverx.js do the following:

$('rel["clickover"]').popoverx({
   fire_on : 'hover',
   hover_delay_close: 3000
});

The usage about 'fire_on' and 'hover_delay_close' has been described on the javscript source.
